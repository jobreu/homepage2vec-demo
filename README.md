## Description

This notebook is meant to demonstrate how URLs can be classified using the `homepage2vec` library for `Python`.

## Usage

***IMPORTANT***: The demo notebook hosted on *MyBinder.org* is only meant for testing purposes. Hence, it should only be used for a few test URLs. If you want to use the functions/code provided here to classify a large number of URLs for your research, please copy/clone the notebook and run the notebook (or the code it contains) on your local machine or your own server. The easiest way of using and editing `Jupyter` notebooks on your machine is probably [*Anaconda*](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## Acknowledgment

If you use `Homepage2Vec` for your research, make sure to cite the associated conference paper:

Lugeon, S., Piccardi, T., & West, R. (2022). Language-Agnostic Website Embedding and Classification. *arXiv preprint [arXiv:2201.03677](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03677.pdf)*.

The `homepage2vec` library is based on the [dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Curlie_Dataset_-_Language-agnostic_Website_Embedding_and_Classification/19406693) from [curlie.org](https://curlie.org/).

*Note*: If you work with web tracking data and (can) also use `R`, the notebook in this repo pairs nicely with the [`webtrackR` package](https://github.com/schochastics/webtrackR) (which is still work in progress at the moment).
